### Architecture

Everything: bot, server and the contract are written in Rust. The contract is a vApp proven on a zkVM. 

This proof is used for settlement on [Hyli](https://hyli.org/), a blockchain where every app is a vApp and where the execution is offchain, the consensus is only verifying the proof
